# Web Projects Collection

This repository contains a set of mini web development projects organized into folders.  
Each folder represents a different lab or task, with its own HTML and CSS files.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- first/ – Lab 1
- second/ – Lab 2
- third/ – Lab 3
- fourth/ – Lab 4
- fifth/ – Lab 5
- sixth/ – Lab 6
- seventh/ – Lab 7
- eighth/ – Lab 8 (if added later)
- ninth/ – Lab 9
- tenth/ – Lab 10: Advanced DOM & API Interaction

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (DOM & API for Lab 10)

## 🌐 Notes

- Task names in Lab 10 may appear in Latin because we are using the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) fake API for testing.
- All folders are self-contained — you can open any index.html file directly in the browser.
- You can explore each lab individually from the corresponding folder.

## 🚀 How to View

To view a project:
1. Open the folder (e.g. fifth/)
2. Open index.html in your browser.

Or you can deploy each folder separately using GitHub Pages if needed.
