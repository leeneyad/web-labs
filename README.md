## 🌐 Notes


- All folders are self-contained — you can open any index.html file directly in the browser.
- You can explore each lab individually from the corresponding folder.

1. Open the folder (e.g. fifth/)
2. Open index.html in your browser.

Or you can deploy each folder separately using GitHub Pages if needed.
